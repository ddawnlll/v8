"""Declared cost model for the swing family's decision-plane replay.

One campaign's cost is split into separate, individually labelled fields so that a
number can never silently borrow authority from a neighbour:

* ``fee_cost_return`` — **measured**: the venue's published taker fee, applied by the
  replay on both legs.
* ``funding_cost_return`` — **measured**: real settlement rows read from the tape's
  ``funding`` channel, applied at the real settlement timestamps while the position is
  open, signed by direction. Coverage is checked against the venue grid derived from
  the declared funding interval; a partial span is reported as partial, never as
  complete and never as zero.
* ``slippage_modelled_return`` — **modelled**: a declared, data-supported rule (a number
  of ticks, or a fraction of the entry bar's range). It is an assumption and is named as
  one; it may never be reported as measured execution shortfall.
* ``execution_shortfall_measured_return`` — **measured only**. Without mark price or an
  order book this stays ``None`` with status ``MISSING_NO_MARK_OR_BOOK_DATA``. It is not
  filled with the modelled number.

A missing measurement is ``None`` plus a named status; it is never ``0``.
