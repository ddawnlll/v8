"""Declarative multi-asset basket definitions over the real quad tape.

A basket is membership plus a weighting rule, decided before the run. Execution
is *not* implemented here: it is delegated to the native ``BacktestEngine``
through :mod:`v8_next.adapters.basket_backtest`, so capital, netting, margin,
commission and funding settlement all stay engine-owned and are never
independently aggregated into a second set of books.

Loading is delegated to :func:`v8_next.evaluation.multitape.load_multitape`, the
one multi-asset tape reader in this codebase. That keeps the tape's own integrity
contracts in force here: duplicated bar slots are a hard error, a leg that would
lose bars to the chronological intersection is reported rather than trimmed
silently, and a funding record without an interval is recorded as an absence
instead of the 8h venue convention. Nothing is synthesized: every price is a
venue kline from the tape.
