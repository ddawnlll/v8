"""14-metric system robustness vector — port of v8-core/src/system_proving/metrics.rs
(D-147, D-149, M3).

Field names are the Rust ones. The Rust invariant is carried over verbatim: the cashflow
discrepancy must be zero for valid double-entry reconciliation.

#457: a published field name is a claim about what was measured. Every field of the vector is
one of three declared things, and which one it is travels with the vector:

* ``MEASURED``   — a function of its own named inputs through its own expression; no two
  measured fields share one expression;
* ``DERIVED``    — a declared restatement of exactly one other named field (``derived_from``),
  never a hidden copy;
* ``UNMEASURED`` — ``null`` plus a reason naming the input this producer does not carry.

No field is a literal constant, another field's copy, or another quantity's clamp. The
per-field basis is published beside the vector (:meth:`SystemRobustnessVector.field_reports`),
so a reader of the artifact reads an absent measurement as an absent measurement instead of a
pass-shaped number.
