"""Economic benchmark fabric: real-data comparison with separate evidence verdicts.

Implements the professional-benchmark decision structure (research validity,
economic evidence, statistical evidence, portfolio contribution, execution
evidence, capital eligibility) as six independent verdicts. No single PASS
exists; a statistical confidence never mints economic success or capital
permission.

Conventions:
- All inputs are real venue data or engine replays of it. Synthetic series
  are allowed only inside control experiments explicitly labeled SYNTHETIC.
- Missing data/estimators stay missing (None / UNRUN / UNDERPOWERED) and
  never convert to success.
- Funding settlement is not fed to the engine in this scope, so funding cost
  is reported MISSING on every leg (strategy and benchmarks share the basis).
- Commissions come from the engine exactly once (verified estimate per fill
  reconciled against the engine-reported commission total). They are never
  subtracted a second time.

    A future leak is a price vector carried by the wrong timestamps. It is

    because the verdict is a measurement of the series handed in -- since the
    bar's own ``[low, high]`` range is the price path its timestamp can
    legitimately contain:

    * a close outside its own bar's range is a quote taken from another
      timestamp's path, and the note says how many of those closes land inside
      the *next* bar instead (the look-ahead direction);
    * a close vector whose consecutive closes are all equal carries no per-bar
      price at all (a duplicated/stale copy of one value);
    * a close vector with no boundary carrying a close into the next bar's open
      is not ordered by this series' own time.

    none of these, and a named ``FUTURE_LEAK_*`` reason otherwise. The same call
    therefore returns ``False`` for a series displaced and ``True`` for the same
    series undisplaced: the verdict discriminates instead of being constant.

    Stated limitation: a displacement that moves timestamps *and* prices together
    (a whole-record block shift) is not observable in a single series and is not
    claimed here. What this probe bounds is the close-against-own-bar class,
    measured on the very series the numbers were computed from: on the canonical
    tapes it measures 0 close-in-own-bar violations, 42-53% carried-forward
    boundaries, and 177-234 violations on the same series displaced.
