"""V8 Evidence Dashboard & Policy Certificate (D-153, D-152 §5).

Enforces:
- Epistemic separation between Research Capability, Robustness, and Capital Projection.
- Multiplicative Readiness Index:
  Readiness = (Cap / 100) * EvidenceMultiplier * (Robustness / 100) * (Economic / 100) * 100
- Binary Robustness Seal & Hard Gate Vector verification.
- Multi-population evidence topology (12-month quad tape as single diagnostic cell).
- Terminal ASCII and HTML certificate rendering.

#441: an absent factor is published with a named source, never as a bare hole. The
economic factor has one producer (the optional ``projection`` argument); when no
producer exists the derivation says so with a stable token
(``ECONOMIC_FACTOR_UNPRODUCED``), so a reader can tell an unimplemented source from
a measurement that has not arrived. No token ever carries a number.
