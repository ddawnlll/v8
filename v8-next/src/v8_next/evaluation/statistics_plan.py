"""NX07 (#428) — the statistical plan is pinned before any result is seen.

Everything a multiplicity correction depends on lives in one immutable record:
block length, resampling count, seed, the declared trial multiplicity, the
effective-independent-trials declaration and its basis, the CSCV partitions, and
-- explicitly -- which statistics are **authority conditions** and which are
**diagnostics**.

Two rules are enforced here rather than trusted to callers:

* a family's plan is pinned once. Re-pinning the same content is a no-op;
  re-pinning different content for the same family raises, because choosing a
  longer block, a luckier seed, or a smaller multiplicity after seeing a p-value
  is exactly the tuning this contract forbids;
* authority and diagnostic sets must both be non-empty and disjoint, so a
  receipt can never present a diagnostic as the condition the gate turned on.
