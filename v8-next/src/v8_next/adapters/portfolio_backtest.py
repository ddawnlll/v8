"""Multi-asset portfolio backtest: one account, N instruments, real funding feed.

P and P+E both execute inside a single Nautilus MARGIN/NETTING account with
shared capital and margin. P attaches one incumbent ensemble per leg; P+E
attaches incumbent + challenger ensembles per leg with halved notionals, so
the total per-leg risk budget is identical and the comparison is engine-level,
never a summation of standalone P&Ls.

Funding settles natively: every in-window tape funding row becomes a
MarkPriceUpdate (mark = leg close at the boundary, labeled mark-proxy) plus a
FundingRateUpdate. Settlement counts and funding-paid reconciliation are
reported; rows outside the window are excluded, never extrapolated.
