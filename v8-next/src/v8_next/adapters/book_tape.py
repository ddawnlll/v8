"""Captured Binance depth snapshots -> deterministic Nautilus OrderBookDelta stream.

What the capture actually contains
----------------------------------
``binance_capture.capture_depth`` stores a *sequence of point-in-time snapshots*
of the venue's public REST depth endpoint. Each snapshot is the full displayed
aggregated book (price level -> resting size) at the instant it was polled; it is
not a change stream, and Binance publishes no order-level (L3) data publicly.
Converting a snapshot into engine input therefore means: at the snapshot's venue
timestamp the book *was* exactly these levels, so the reader emits a ``CLEAR``
followed by one ``ADD`` per level. Nothing between two snapshots is invented; a
consumer that needs sub-snapshot resolution does not have it and must say so.

Why the top N levels and not all of them
----------------------------------------
``DEPTH_LEVEL_BOUND`` (10) bounds each side because:

* the venue's REST book is aggregated L2 (market-by-price), so 10 levels per side
  is already more depth than the order sizes this lab can trade consume, which
  means the bound cannot be hiding the level a fill would have hit;
* it fixes the delta count per snapshot deterministically (one CLEAR plus 2N
  ADDs), so a 15-minute capture replays in a bounded, reproducible way;
* levels *beyond* the bound are dropped and **counted** (``levels_beyond_bound``),
  so the truncation is reported rather than silently assumed away.

Determinism
-----------
Snapshots are read in filename order, the venue timestamp ordering is validated
to be non-decreasing, and every delta carries its snapshot index as its sequence
number. :func:`book_digest` hashes the full delta set, so reading the same
capture twice yields the same digest; a test asserts exactly that.

Fail-closed policy
------------------
A level row that is not a two-element, positive, parseable price/size pair is
dropped and counted. A snapshot whose venue timestamp is absent, or one side of
which parses to zero levels, is dropped and counted. A missing venue clock is
never replaced with the local capture clock, because that would mix two clocks
inside one stream.
