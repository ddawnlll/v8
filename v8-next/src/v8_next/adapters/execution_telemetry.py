"""Execution telemetry: turn a Nautilus fills report into measured evidence.

Kept separate from the engine adapters so both the single-instrument D-153
runner and the multi-asset portfolio backtest measure execution the same way
and cannot drift apart.

Honesty rules encoded here:
  * a value that cannot be parsed stays ``None`` -- never a placeholder;
  * non-finite floats (the engine emits ``nan`` slippage on some rows) become
    ``None`` so a receipt stays strictly JSON-serialisable;
  * amounts in different currencies are never summed together;
  * shortfall compares a fill only against the decision of the SAME instrument,
    because comparing legs compares different price scales;
  * the signed mean shortfall (net cost) and the mean magnitude of shortfall
    (deviation from the decision price) are both published, because averaging a
    signed quantity into a fidelity score lets opposite-signed fills cancel.

Decision-trail binding (additive surface, EEO-001H / EEO-002 / D-136):

  * :func:`attach_decision_trail` attaches a structured, hash-bound decision trail to a decision
    record, so ``v8_next.app.explain`` can answer a single-trade counterfactual with the PIT
    decision lineage beside it instead of prose. Spans must be PIT ``DecisionSpan``s on the
    context's own trace; an evidence-plane or foreign-trace span is refused by name;
  * :func:`decision_trail_digest` / :func:`verify_decision_trail` are the fail-closed read side:
    a trail whose digest does not re-derive from its content is not a trail;
  * nothing above changes the behaviour of the measurement functions in this module, and the
    input record is never mutated: the trail is returned in a copy.

    Returns a **new** mapping -- ``{**payload, "decision_trail": trail}`` -- so a sibling reader of
    the input record is unaffected. The trail is JSON-serialisable and carries:

    * ``trace_context``: opportunity id, trajectory modality/tag, PIT timestamp and provenance;
    * ``spans``: the ordered PIT decision spans, with their stages, links and receipt ids;
    * ``counterfactual_branches``: every ``SpanLinkType.CounterfactualBranch`` link, so
      ``v8_next.app.explain`` reads the counterfactual lineage off the trail rather than inferring
      it from the outcome;
    * ``trail_digest``: :func:`decision_trail_digest` over everything above.

    Raises :class:`TraceLineageError` when a span is not a PIT decision span or belongs to another
    trace: a trail is evidence of a decision path, so a span that was not on that path cannot be
    packaged into one.
