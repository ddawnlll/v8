"""Readiness audit for the locked benchmark (docs/contracts/V87_READINESS_BENCHMARK_SPEC.md).

Answers "how production-ready are we" with four separately printed factors, never one
number on its own. Every factor is derived from artifacts on disk:

* ``gate_factor``   - gates PASS / 10, from the resolved battery artifact when one is
                      published under its own producer's contract (#447), else from the
                      latest ledger receipt's gate vector
* ``pillar_factor`` - measured pillars / 3: P1 gate battery, P2 four-year paper-trade
                      report, P3 synthetic hypothesis scenarios. A pillar whose artifacts
                      are absent is MISSING and contributes 0 - it is never filled in.
* ``risk_factor``   - 1 only when every declared risk limit is measured against the
                      paper-trade record and respected; 0 on any breach, and 0 on a limit
                      whose source publishes no number, or publishes it on a different
                      basis (UNMEASURED, named); MISSING when there is no record at all
* ``target_factor`` - protected monthly return / 10 % (the red apple), capped at 1. It is
                      diagnostic-only (contributes 0) on a window that is not protected.

Nothing here mints authority: the verdict stays NO_ECONOMIC_CLAIM and the report names
exactly which measurement is missing next.
