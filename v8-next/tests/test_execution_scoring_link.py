"""MECHANICS ONLY (no tape) + real-tape discrimination tests.

No economic claim is made anywhere in this file. The mechanics section pins how
the ExecutionFidelity domain decides between *measured* execution evidence and
the legacy PnL-Sharpe proxy, which measured statistic it reads, when a present
statistic is degenerate and must therefore abstain under a named reason (#439),
and what it publishes about that choice. The last section runs the shared
portfolio engine over the real quad tape — it is evaluative, skips when the tape
is absent, and asserts only that the published dimension follows the measured
shortfall (and abstains on a degenerate one) instead of reporting a constant.
