"""#495: the product dashboard reads the gate key that is actually published.

The rename of ``g3_benchmark_coverage`` -> ``g3_scenario_robustness`` reached
``GateVector``, the descriptor, ``scoring.py`` and ``app/portfolio.py``, but not the
committed dashboard ``site/app.html``, whose gate order still asked for the old key.
After the rename that cell would silently render ``UNKNOWN`` on a receipt that measured
it — the "silent default" failure mode #495 exists to remove, moved into a renderer.

Ledger entries written before the rename were digested under the old key and are
immutable (D-164), so the dashboard must still *read* it as a fallback. Both halves are
asserted here.
