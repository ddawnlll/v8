"""#457 — no field of the robustness vector publishes a quantity it did not measure.

The defect: the 14-field system robustness vector that the four-year P2 artifact publishes
carried seven fields whose names were not measurements of those names —

* ``recovery_horizon_bars`` / ``expert_displacement_rate`` were literal constants (``0`` /
  ``0.0``);
* ``turnover_efficiency`` and ``habitat_selectivity_score`` were two names for ONE expression
  (``min(1.0, campaigns / bars)``), byte-identical in the artifact for both families;
* ``capital_utilization_pct`` was the fee column rescaled and clamped
  (``min(100.0, |fee_cost_sum| * 100)`` — both families clamped to exactly ``100.0``);
* ``ruin_margin_pct`` was ``100 - max_adverse_excursion_pct``, the drawdown restated as a
  margin with no declaration that it was a restatement.

No field carried a MISSING marker, so a reader (and every pillar/risk reader that loads this
artifact) read an unmeasured surface as a measured one.

Acceptance (measurable; needs no tape scan):

A1. No published field is a literal constant and no two fields are computed from one
    expression — asserted on the source (AST, no numeric literal in the constructor call) and
    on the per-field basis table (no two MEASURED fields share a signature).
A2. Every field is a function of its own named inputs: varying one input moves exactly the
    fields that name it and no others; an input the producer cannot supply publishes ``null``
    plus a named reason instead of a pass-shaped number.
A3. ``capital_utilization_pct`` is not ``min(100, |fee| * 100)``: it is ``null`` with the named
    reason "no position sizing / no capital basis in this producer", and two different fee
    totals cannot collapse onto one clamp value.
A4. The drawdown/ruin pair names its basis (``uncompounded_sum_of_campaign_returns`` + unit) in
    the artifact, and the drawdown's restatement is declared DERIVED.
A5. The regenerated artifact carries no ``100.0`` capital-utilization clamp and no constant
    field, while the stored receipt identities/digests are unchanged.
A6. Readiness is not fed by this vector at all (none of the 14 names appears in the readiness
    reader), so no gate value, ``claim_status`` or verdict can move as a side effect.

MECHANICS ONLY: the campaign columns in this module are synthetic arithmetic fixtures with
zero evaluative weight — they exercise the publication contract, not the market. The artifact
assertions at the end read the frozen canonical artifact and skip when it is absent.
