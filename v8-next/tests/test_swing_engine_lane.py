"""Engine-lane regression tests (real tape; no economic claim).

These lock the semantics the reconciliation relies on, so a later change cannot quietly
alter how a decision becomes an order:

* a decision whose protection did not form (``stop_price == entry_reference``) is inserted
  **unprotected** and sized on the declared notional — never rejected as a zero-distance
  bracket, and never stopped out at its own entry;
* a bracketed decision rests exactly two protection orders after its entry fill;
* a timeout close retires the resting legs instead of leaving an orphan that would fill
  later and open an untracked position;
* every fill happens at or after its decision instant (no future data), and every order
  respects the instrument's lot step.

The tape is real; the assertions are about mechanics and causality, not about returns.
