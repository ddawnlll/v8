"""#471 — the portfolio producer's structural cells are measured, never minted by defaults.

The producer defect: ``app/portfolio.py`` built its ``GateVector`` with

    evaluate_gate_vector(total_bars=..., total_trades=..., pnl_series=...)

so the three blocking/required cells -- G0 identity, G1 causal PIT, G2 determinism
ledger -- were decided by the rule's keyword *defaults* (``has_continuous_lineage=True``,
``is_causal_pit=True``, ``mismatches=0``), i.e. by the absence of an argument. The
canonical resolver ``evaluation.gate_resolution.resolve_structural_gates`` exists to
produce exactly those three cells from measurement, so a published PASS stood behind no
per-bar lineage / PIT / ledger measurement on the portfolio path, and that vector is
hashed into the receipt digest and appended to the durable ledger.

These tests exercise the ``portfolio.py`` producer itself -- the function the run's
call site invokes -- and assert its structural cells against the canonical resolver for
the same inputs, cell for cell.

Evidence class: producer wiring (mechanics). The bars below are hand-made, marked
MECHANICS ONLY and never quoted as a result: what is under test is *which* inputs decide
the three structural cells, not economic performance. No test here requires a PASS, a
capability score or a readiness index on synthetic input.
