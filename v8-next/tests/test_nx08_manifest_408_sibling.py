"""#408 sibling (t_a1cf3a66) — the NX08 gate manifest tool must run to completion.

`v8-next/tools/nx08_gate_manifest.py` publishes a STRUCTURE DEMO receipt that used
to hand-give its capability score (``42.0``) with no score evidence bound, so #408's
binding rule refused it: the tool died *after* writing ``gate_manifest.json`` and
*before* ``scoring_manifest.json``, leaving half its outputs refreshed and a
non-zero exit code.

What is held here is the defect class, not the one literal:

* the tool runs to completion and writes BOTH artifacts;
* the demo's number is the canonical breakdown's aggregate over the determinants the
  manifest declares, and the receipt is verified by re-deriving that number from the
  evidence it binds (``receipt_verifies``), so a hand-given number cannot pass;
* the gate map's own consistency check still equals ``validate_registry()``;
* the demo stays classified ``SYNTHETIC_STRUCTURE_ONLY_NOT_A_MEASUREMENT`` and is not
  published as a capability result.
