"""#448 — the latest-benchmark reader publishes only from an evidential entry.

The defect: ``cli status`` (and every other reader of the canonical ledger) took
``ledger.entries[-1]`` and published its capability score as *the* latest benchmark.
The newest entry is not a measurement class, so a run whose receipt declares no window
evidence at all -- every stored record before the class existed -- had its number
published as if a window that may mint a score had produced it. The canonical ledger's
seq 20 entry is exactly that shape (digest version ``v8.5-digest-v5``, no
``window_evidence`` key at all) and its 14.0 was being published.

The fix is a classifier on the *declaration* the receipt itself carries:
:meth:`BenchmarkReceipt.declares_evidential_window` -- true only when the receipt binds
a :class:`WindowEvidence` whose ``economic_evidence`` is true -- and a selector
(:meth:`BenchmarkLedger.publication`) that takes the most recent entry declaring it.
With no such entry the reader refuses by name (:data:`NO_EVIDENTIAL_LEDGER_ENTRY`),
quoting the entry and the class it refused, and the number is never printed.

Evidence classes:

* **mechanics** -- the reader rule and its refusals, on MECHANICS ONLY fixtures: no
  assertion here claims performance, minting or authority.
* **evaluative** -- the same reader applied to the *real* canonical ledger
  (``artifacts/benchmarks/benchmark_ledger.jsonl``), which is read-only here: nothing in
  this file writes to it, and the test skips when it is absent.
