"""#445 — the fail-closed cost residual is published INSIDE the receipt.

The defect: a `MISMATCH`/`UNKNOWN` cost state was published (`metrics.portfolio_P
.cost_basis`, verdict `EXECUTION_UNPROVEN`) while the measurement it rests on --
`|engine_series_residual_usdt| > PORTFOLIO_LOOP_ATOL` -- existed only as a
returned-dict field with no writer. The bound receipt/report carried the decision
and not one `residual` token (grep = 0).

Acceptance (measurable):

1. A curve whose `cost_basis` is `MISMATCH` publishes, INSIDE the receipt,
   `metrics.<curve>.cost_reconciliation.engine_series_residual_usdt` finite and
   not null, with the terms it came from (`closed_loop_terms`), the state
   (`engine_series_ok`) and the bound it was compared against
   (`engine_series_tolerance_usdt`).
2. The published residual is a function of the magnitudes the receipt itself
   carries: recomputed from `closed_loop_terms` it equals the stored value.
3. The `UNKNOWN` (unmeasurable) path stays distinguishable and publishes NO
   residual: `state = NOT_MEASURED`, a null residual and a named reason.
4. The two closed-loop identities in this module -- strategy
   (`balance_delta - sum_realized - open_realized`) and portfolio
   (`balance_delta - sum_realized + open_entry_comm`) -- are measured on ONE
   engine balance: they either agree, or diverge with a named reason. A
   divergence is never reported as agreement.

Mechanics-only (`MECHANICS ONLY`, zero evaluative weight): every engine result
here is a synthetic fixture built to inject ONE discrepancy into an otherwise
closed ledger, so the assertions measure the publication, not the market. The
read-only assertions at the end run against the frozen canonical artifact and
the canonical ledger, and skip when they are absent.
