"""#443 — the frozen OOS slice publishes ITS OWN cost/flow, not the window's.

Evidence classes:

* **mechanics** — the slice-flow arithmetic (`oos_slice_flow`) and the
  engine-fill partition, on synthetic engine ledgers and synthetic bars.
  MECHANICS ONLY: no evaluative weight, no economic claim, no real tape.
* **evaluative** — the canonical quad portfolio receipt regenerated on the real
  tape: acceptance (a)+(b) of #443 measured on the published rows, and the
  pre-slice flow recomputed independently from the same tape. Skips when the
  real tape is absent.

The defect: both OOS constructors handed the FULL-window `turnover`,
`commission` and `n_trades` to the slice's `MetricSet` while appending
`+OOS_SLICE` to its `cost_basis`, so a curve that buys once at bar 0 published
that fill's cost on the last-150-bar row.
