"""Four-year simulated paper-trade report with v8-core attribution (P2 of the locked benchmark).

Runs the pre-registered swing family over the four-year tape, then reports it the way the
ported audit kernel requires:

* every losing campaign is charged to exactly one of the **7 disjoint failure domains**
  (``system_proving.attribution``) and the conservation invariant is verified;
* the run is summarised as the **14-metric robustness vector** and sealed in a
  ``SystemProvingGroundReceipt`` with its digest;
* every field of that vector carries its own basis and every field this producer cannot
  measure is published as ``null`` with a named reason (#457) — a published name is a claim
  about what was measured;
* costs stay in separate columns (measured fee, measured funding, modelled slippage) and the
  measured execution shortfall stays absent;
* the **bracket contract** is published as two declared readings with their campaign counts
  and their divergence class (#459): inside one iteration the bracket flag comes from ONE
  source and is handed to both the replay and the failure classifier, a decision whose own
  protection never formed is counted, and neither reading is reconciled away.

Nothing here is an economic claim: it is a diagnostic report over real bars.
