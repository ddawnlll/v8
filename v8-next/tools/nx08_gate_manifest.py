"""NX08 (#429) — dump the canonical gate map and the scoring/coverage artifacts.

Everything written here is read back from the live objects (the descriptor table,
GateVector, the resolvers, the scoring module and the certificate generator), so
the manifest is a measurement of the code rather than a transcription of it. The
gate map is written with its own consistency check result: if the map did not match
GateVector, the manifest would say so instead of hiding it.

Usage (from the repository root):

    uv run --project v8-next --extra dev --extra research \\
        python v8-next/tools/nx08_gate_manifest.py
